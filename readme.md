![main pic]("https://github.com/nekkiichi/terminal-pyhon-snake-game/blob/main/assets/Screenshot%202022-05-08%20151924.png")

this is my first python project i try to make without using any tutorials. this project is a simple terminal game with minimal external python library. Don't expect anything fancy here, i'm too lazy for refactoring any things


essential external python library that i'm used tn this repo: 
- `pyinstaller` for creating executable file
- `keybord` for receiving continous input from keyboard

## Requirements
just python3, and a terminal

## Installation:
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
